## A tool for steganography that filters and gets output out of other tools.


This project is all about steganography, while it was made for CTFs, it could be used for more.
The tool is written with Python, and it's being updated once in a while.
The tool itself is made for linux, and it won't work on anything else.

* Search for keywords in metadata of images
* Automatically finds emails, base64 encryptions, urls, and more.
* Easy to use!
